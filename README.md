This is a cypher program. Type either 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' type the text, key and then there's your cyphered message or plaintext message. When downloading, your antivirus may think this is a virus but it is not. If you are still suspicious, you can check the code in 'CaesarCipher++.py'.

Please note I'm currently still learning the basics of python and done some things wrong please create an Issue in the 'Issues' tab if you spot any.
